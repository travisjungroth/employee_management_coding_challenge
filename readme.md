# Coding Challenge: Employee Management

This code is the very beginning of an employee management system for a company. There are three failing tests that need to be fixed.

 * The test code can be assumed to be perfect. Only edit `employees.py`.
 * The code is Python 2 and Python 3 compatible and has no dependencies.
 
### Running the tests
```
python -m unittests tests
```
### Submitting the code
Create a secret gist of `employees.py` and send a link to jungroth@gmail.com.
